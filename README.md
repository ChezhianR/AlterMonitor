# AlterMonitor

This can be used to monitor any folders in Windows platfoem. It reads the file content and matches the keywords given in keywords.txt, when matched it displays an alert to user. 

It reads data from excel file and matches with the keywords. Excel file can be read in many way,where as this application considers it as database and every sheets as table. which was one of the easiest way for me to match the searched text.
